Hi üëã 
I am a passionate front-end developer with some experience in this field, with a background in Leadership & Project Management.
I have found that this process is about trying, making mistakes, failing, asking, and finally succeeding. 
I love to code, and I have a big ambition to become a full-stack developer.
