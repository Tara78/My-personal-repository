# Hi 👋

 
I am a passionate front-end developer with some experience in this field, with a background in Leadership & Project Management.
I love to code, and I have a big ambition to become a full-stack developer.

I have found that this process is about trying, making mistakes, failing, asking, and finally succeeding. 
&nbsp;

🚀 🎯 I’m currently working to become a top notch front-end developer.
